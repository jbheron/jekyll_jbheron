    <h2>What about me?</h2>
       <p>As of August 2015 I have been documenting all things Cloud at Pivotal. I can be reached through any of the contact links at this site. </p>
       <br>
      <h2 class="text-justify">I am a tech writer.</h2>
        <p>For the last several years I have been happily developing web content, writing technical documents and I got some technical chops at Dev Bootcamp. I've always been a craftsman of one sort or another. I have made web apps, manuals, movies, houses, furniture, commercials, and one screenplay.</p>
        <br>
       <h2>And, before that?</h2>
        <p>I was trained in the creative and technical craft of film making, but early on found myself building houses on the far away island of Nantucket. Why? </p>
        <br>
        	<h2>Because life is a big, fat amazing ride.</h2>
        <p>After enough blustery winters to appreciate good weather, I traded my beard and hammer for a bag of hopes and a pen in Hollywood. When I met my future wife, we waved goodbye to LA and headed homeward-- back to the Bay Area!</p> 
        <br>
		<h2>What do I value?</h2>
        <p> I bring years of experience in the technical contribution to the communication, implementation and vision of products in technology. I value empathy, humor, clarity, transparency and teamwork, and I hope you do too! </p>
